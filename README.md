# 0xpass
0xPass is a distributed and programmable, MPC-based key management network. 

### Key Management
Unlike trad MPC solns, all key shares are distributed across network nodes making the private keys fully programmable. Key shares are secured through enclaves and the private key never comes together in whole because of MPC.
For you this means - 

- Custom KMS authentication logic possible (including social logins)
- You can schedule/automate transactions
- Key recovery is a lot cleaner since it's not dependent on user's device or shards
- Cloud MPC wallets are interoperable
